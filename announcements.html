            <h3>Overview and Objectives</h3>
            <p>
                The Language & Health Research Program at the Institut du Savoir Montfort (ISM) invites applications for a two-year Postdoctoral Fellowship focused on improving health and access to health services for linguistic minority communities, with a particular emphasis on Francophone minority communities in Ontario as well as in Canada. This fellowship aims to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accelerate world-class, policy-relevant research on language, equity, and health systems;</li>
                <li>Build capacity in mixed-methods, economic evaluation, and data-driven approaches (including AI and precision health) for linguistic minority communities;</li>
                <li>Foster interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations across hospitals, primary care, universities, service planning entities, and community partners.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research Program</h3>
            <p>
                The Language & Health Research Program at the Institut du Savoir Montfort (ISM) is a national network of researchers advancing the health of linguistic minorities and understanding of the influence of language as a social determinant of health. The program is led by Dr Sathya Karunananthan and Dr Sharon Johnston and this highly collaborative and productive group have a strong track record of impactful work and mixed methods research including using large administrative databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program hosts a bi-weekly discussion forum dedicated to advancing health equity research, with a particular focus on language as a social determinant of health. The forum is attended by researchers and health leaders, working in this area and meets virtually for one hour, twice a month, to discuss recent developments in language and health research, share knowledge dissemination opportunities, and present ongoing projects. Presentations and discussions are held in both French and English to reflect the group's bilingual nature.
            </p>
