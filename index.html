        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            The LangHealth Group is an open forum dedicated to advancing health equity research, with a particular focus on language as a social determinant of health. The group is primarily composed of researchers working in this area and meets virtually for one hour, twice a month, to discuss recent developments in language and health research, share knowledge dissemination opportunities, and present ongoing projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Presentations and discussions are held in both French and English to reflect the group's bilingual nature. The organization of this group is facilitated by both the Associate Vice President, Research and Scientific Director, Dr Sharon Johnston, and Research Chair in Language as a Social Determinant of Health, Dr Sathya Karunananthan, at Institut du Savoir Montfort.
